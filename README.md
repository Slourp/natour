## Application Overview 🎢

The application offers various features, some of which include:

- **Users**: Users can sign up, log in, log out, update their password, reset their password, update their general information, and access their profile page. Users can be regular users, admins, lead-guides, or guides, with the default role being a regular user upon signup. 👤🔒📝

- **Tours**: Tours can be created, viewed, updated, and deleted by an admin user or a lead-guide. Each tour comprises a series of carefully picked locations to ignite an individual's adventurous spirit. 🌍🚁🛳️
